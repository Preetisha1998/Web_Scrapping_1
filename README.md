# Web_Scrapping_1
This is a simple web scrapping code.
The data which is scrapped, is in the form of a csv file. "Quotes1" contains the scrapping of only 1 page and "Quptes2" contains the scrapping of all the urls associated with that page. 
The dataset is formed in such a way that 1st column is the quote and second column is the name of the Author of that quote!

The data is scrapped from: http://quotes.toscrape.com/
